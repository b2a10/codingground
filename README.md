# Coding Ground
My try at "Learn Python The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw.

Keeping this as a sort of progress report, and until I can get it saved onto home computer.

7/19/16: Unfortunately lost the first ten exercises, so I'll be starting from exercise 11.

7/20/16: Lost exercises 19 and 20.

Evidently anything I do on the (wonderful) "Coding Ground" site gets put here, and I'm also working on a country simulation type idea, this isn't titled to go along with my Python progress.
