# Coding Ground
My try at "Learn Python The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw.

Keeping this as a sort of progress report, and until I can get it saved onto home computer.

7/19/16: Unfortunately lost the first ten exercises, so I'll be starting from exercise 11 on here.

7/20/16: Lost exercises 19 and 20. (Due to losing connection to codingground and not being able to get my non-exported files back).

7/22/16: Skipped writing out exercise 28 (did it on paper though) - already have done plenty of boolean logic practice. 
	Lost exercises 29 and 30. No big deal, as they were just if statements but still a bummer.

7/29/16: <strike>Lost exercises 35 and 36... as well as the small program text game I was messing around with. Damn internet connection...</strike> Nevermind, it fixed itself for a first.

Evidently anything I do on the (wonderful) "Coding Ground" site gets put here, and I'm also working on a country simulation type idea, whcih is lumped in here along with my Python progress.
